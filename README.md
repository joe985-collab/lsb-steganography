# lsb-steganography
This is inspired by from the project by Mason Edgar. link: https://github.com/MasonEdgar/DCT-Image-Steganography
I have instead used DC coefficients of all channels for lsb substitution. Also added encoder and decoder code to roughly demonstrate the encoding and decoding process.
